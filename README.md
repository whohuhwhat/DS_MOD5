# Convolutional Neural Network Image Classification: Emotions, Race, Gender

# Project Overview
For my final project, I took a deeper dive into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).  Using Keras, TensorFlow GPU and cuDNN, I trained a CNN to take an image and have it classify what emotion the person in the image was expressing.  I then trained additional CNNs to classify the race and gender of the person in the image.
